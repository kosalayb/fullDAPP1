This project develops a Dapp for cheking soil compliance following and implementing ZKP protocol in solidity as a smart contract. 

Dev Guide:
1. create a project in infura, use api key, update truffle-config.js to connect to infura api using HDWallet and also seed phrase of account created in metamask.
2. Create an account in metamask, get the seed phrase and use it as the secret code in truffle project. Then find free ether from the https://faucet.ropsten.be/
Now you have an account connected to ropsten in metamask and it has its own seed phrase which you can use in the truffle project. Now you can migrate contracts to ropsten test net.
